# Community Plugins

A public, Git-backed marketplace of Codex plugins that developers, prospects,
and enterprise teams can inspect before they install. Each plugin is packaged
with its manifest, setup guide, tests, and license or third-party notices.

This repository is a community distribution source for local Codex, not an
automatic listing in OpenAI's universal Plugins Directory. See
[OpenAI's plugin packaging docs](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins)
for the distinction between public directory publishing and repo marketplaces.

## Add it to Codex

In Codex, choose **Add plugin marketplace** and use a repository slug or clone
URL, not a raw `marketplace.json` URL:

```text
Source: tonyloehr/community-plugins
Git ref: main
Sparse paths:
.agents/plugins
plugins
```

Those two sparse paths load the complete plugin catalog without pulling this
repo's tests, demo media, or source receipts. To fetch every repository file,
leave **Sparse paths** blank. To fetch only Grafana Observability, use these two
paths instead:

```text
.agents/plugins
plugins/grafana-observability
```

To fetch only ReviewOps Auditor + Benchmark, use:

```text
.agents/plugins
plugins/reviewops-auditor-benchmark
```

To fetch only React Native to SwiftUI, use:

```text
.agents/plugins
plugins/react-native-to-swiftui
```

Adding a marketplace makes its catalog available to browse. It does **not**
install, enable, or authenticate every plugin. After adding it, install only
the plugin you want.

The same flow from the CLI:

```sh
# Load the full catalog efficiently.
codex plugin marketplace add tonyloehr/community-plugins \
  --ref main \
  --sparse .agents/plugins \
  --sparse plugins

# Install one plugin from that catalog.
codex plugin add grafana-observability@community-plugins

# Or install the offline ReviewOps package.
codex plugin add reviewops-auditor-benchmark@community-plugins

# Or install the bounded native-migration workflow.
codex plugin add react-native-to-swiftui@community-plugins
```

If you want a full checkout instead of a sparse one:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add tonyloehr/community-plugins --ref main
```

The `@community-plugins` selector comes from the top-level `name` in
[the marketplace manifest](.agents/plugins/marketplace.json), not from the
GitHub URL. Start a new Codex task after installation so its skills and tools
are picked up.

Grafana Observability requires Codex and Node.js 22.19 or newer. Its manifest
declares both `Read` and `Write`. `Write` is limited to
plugin-owned local audit and evidence files; it does not write to Grafana,
datasources, dashboards, services, or deployments.

Its default startup uses a credential-free fixture, so you can verify the
install without touching a Grafana instance:

```text
Use $setup-grafana-observability to check the fixture profile and available packs.
```

ReviewOps Auditor + Benchmark requires Codex and Node.js 22.19 or newer. Its
manifest declares only `Read`; it has no app, MCP server, authentication,
network call, model replay, workflow execution, or writeback path. Its first
run is also synthetic and credential-free:

```text
Use $normalize-review-runs on the bundled synthetic fixture only. Explain the normalization summary, provenance checks, safety boundaries, and next safe step.
```

React Native to SwiftUI requires Codex and Node.js 22.19 or newer. Its
manifest declares both `Read` and `Write`: planning is read-only, while
writes are limited to an explicitly approved target directory for one feature
slice. It has no app or MCP dependency, does not copy source or assets into
the plugin, and does not promise App Store approval. Its first run is a
read-only parity-planning prompt:

```text
Use $plan-react-native-port to inspect only the declared React Native feature and propose a SwiftUI parity contract. Do not edit files yet.
```

## Copy-paste Codex prompts

Browse before installing:

```text
Add the Git-backed marketplace from tonyloehr/community-plugins at ref main. Use sparse paths .agents/plugins and plugins. List the available plugins and recommend the best fit for this repository, but do not install or authenticate anything yet.
```

Install one plugin:

```text
If community-plugins is not already configured, add it from tonyloehr/community-plugins at ref main using sparse paths .agents/plugins and plugins/grafana-observability. Install grafana-observability@community-plugins, explain its permissions and authentication policy, and give me the credential-free smoke-test prompt for a new Codex task.
```

Install ReviewOps without private data:

```text
If community-plugins is not already configured, add it from tonyloehr/community-plugins at ref main using sparse paths .agents/plugins and plugins/reviewops-auditor-benchmark. Install reviewops-auditor-benchmark@community-plugins, explain its read-only offline boundary, and give me the synthetic-fixture smoke-test prompt for a new Codex task.
```

Install React Native to SwiftUI with a read-only first run:

```text
If community-plugins is not already configured, add it from tonyloehr/community-plugins at ref main using sparse paths .agents/plugins and plugins/react-native-to-swiftui. Install react-native-to-swiftui@community-plugins, explain its Read and Write boundaries and ON_USE authentication policy, and give me the read-only parity-planning prompt for a new Codex task.
```

Review before adoption:

```text
Review tonyloehr/community-plugins before I install it. Inspect .agents/plugins/marketplace.json, each plugin manifest, declared capabilities, authentication policy, external endpoints, licenses, and setup instructions. Flag anything that needs security or admin review.
```

## Update or remove

```sh
# Refresh the Git-backed marketplace snapshot.
codex plugin marketplace upgrade community-plugins

# Reinstall a plugin after a new version is published.
codex plugin add grafana-observability@community-plugins
codex plugin add reviewops-auditor-benchmark@community-plugins
codex plugin add react-native-to-swiftui@community-plugins

# Remove the configured marketplace source.
codex plugin marketplace remove community-plugins
```

For an enterprise fork or private mirror, use its HTTPS or SSH clone URL and
make sure Git credentials already work non-interactively. Keep the same
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and `plugins/<name>/` layout.

## Repository layout

```text
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json      # Catalog and install policy
plugins/<plugin-name>/                 # One installable plugin
  .codex-plugin/plugin.json            # Required plugin manifest
  README.md                            # Cold-start setup and safety guidance
tests/<plugin-name>/                   # Plugin-specific verification
