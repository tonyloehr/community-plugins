# Autodesk Fusion marketplace tests

Run the cold package suite from the repository root with Node.js 22.19 or newer:

```sh
npm run test:autodesk-fusion:package
```

This suite uses only Node built-ins and the committed plugin distribution. It
does not install dependencies, build the plugin, launch Autodesk, contact cloud
or model services, access a credential vault, or install a Codex plugin. Each
runtime receives an explicit CLI-created fixture profile whose state and output
paths are redirected to a disposable private directory before startup. The
environment does not inherit the user's Fusion profile or Node preload options.
These are the default synthetic provider's contracts, not a test of a missing
`FUSION_PROFILE` against the user's home directory.

The layout follows the repository's other companion suites:

- `unit/` binds the marketplace entry to its manifest, optional authentication,
  real packaged launcher, first safe prompt, skill metadata and local links, and
  checks that a CLI timeout terminates a test-owned child that ignores SIGTERM.
- `integration/` copies the installable package into a path containing spaces,
  without TypeScript source, tests or `node_modules`, then uses actual JSON-RPC
  over MCP stdio. It checks inspection, unchanged preparation, an authorized
  parameter edit and independent readback, no replay across restart, synthetic
  artifact hashes/provenance, incomplete handoff review, and CLI behavior.
- `security/` checks rejected arbitrary operations, caller approval injection,
  path traversal, absent cloud/native authority, stale or mismatched plans,
  trusted read/mutation restrictions, Manage draft denial without cloud access,
  and changed compiled-bundle rejection.
- `support/` contains the bounded dependency-free stdio client and test-owned
  package/profile cleanup. It does not emulate the Fusion server or its results.

The master command keeps the plugin's deeper suites:

```sh
npm --prefix plugins/autodesk-fusion ci --ignore-scripts
npm run test:autodesk-fusion
```

Use Python 3.12 or newer for the development API/bridge contract suite; set
`FUSION_TEST_PYTHON` to an explicit interpreter when the default `python3`
(`python` on Windows) is unavailable. The cold package tests and normal Codex
startup require neither Python nor development dependencies.

The master suite validates committed package bytes, runs these cold package
checks, builds/typechecks/tests the implementation using its declared development
dependencies, and validates the rebuilt distribution. The repository marketplace
runner discovers the matching master command from the catalog. See the
[plugin qualification guide](../../plugins/autodesk-fusion/docs/qualification.md)
and [implementation status](../../plugins/autodesk-fusion/docs/autodesk-fusion-implementation-status.md)
for the separately tracked platform and live gates.

The STEP fixture is explicitly a protocol sample, not CAD geometry. Analytic box
measurements and successful MCP calls do not qualify the Autodesk kernel, CAM,
cloud recipes, enterprise accounts, actual installed-Codex routing, or engineering
release. These companion checks neither replace the deep tests nor promote their
licensed-provider and platform skips into passes. CI results must be reported
separately after CI runs.

The primary Fusion E2E job invokes this root master on Node 22.19, 24 and 26.
Supplemental Windows/macOS jobs use the same master, while native source-build
jobs remain separate. Marketplace CI calls the catalog-discovered masters, so
adding a catalog entry without its matching test command fails the shared gate.
