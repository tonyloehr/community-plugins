# ReviewOps Auditor + Benchmark tests

The ReviewOps suite is synthetic, offline, and deterministic. The revised
v0.1.0 contract covers four explicit skills and five CLI commands:
`validate-config`, `normalize`, `audit-eval`, `benchmark`, and
`recommend-architecture`.

Run from the repository root:

```sh
npm run test:reviewops-auditor-benchmark
```

The fixture intentionally contains no customer data, provider credentials,
private URLs, real prompts, real diffs, or live integration.

## Required qualification coverage

Before release, the suite must demonstrate:

- strict schema and path validation for lane bundles, source-neutral exports,
  canonical records, protocols, labels, pricing, policies, and outputs;
- bounded normalization with accepted, rejected, duplicate, and reason-code
  reporting;
- fair-evaluation gates for pairing, held constants, allowed differences,
  blinding, leakage controls, adjudication, attribution, and exclusions;
- validity-gated global and per-slice root-cause, quality, cost, latency,
  confidence, stability, and frontier results;
- shadow-only reference-architecture gates, preserved contracts, human
  approval, rollback triggers, and no-posting language;
- secondary static diagnostics that cannot become causal proof without an
  observed, policy-bound shadow-path finding;
- hostile prompt and export data, redaction, path containment, regular-file
  checks, resource limits, stable errors, and text-accessible Markdown;
- copied-package execution without runtime `node_modules`, network,
  credentials, Git metadata, home-directory reads, or provider calls.

## Qualification record

Local revised-contract qualification on 2026-08-24:

- <code>npm run test:reviewops-auditor-benchmark</code>: 106 passed, 0 failed;
- coverage subset: 78 passed, 0 failed; 92.46% lines, 82.83% branches,
  95.10% functions;
- <code>npm run verify:reviewops-source</code>, <code>npm run validate</code>,
  and <code>npm run test:marketplace</code>: passed;
- <code>npm audit --prefix plugins/reviewops-auditor-benchmark --omit=dev</code>:
  0 vulnerabilities;
- both shipped entrypoints passed <code>node --check</code>;
- copied-package and isolated installed-fixture paths ran all five commands
  without credentials, network, provider calls, or writeback.

CI results remain unclaimed until CI actually completes.
