# Generated desktop support matrix

Generated from the shipped typed operation registry. “Implemented” means an actual reviewed handler exists. It does not establish installed entitlement, kernel correctness or live qualification. Exact argument schemas are in `operation-catalog.json` and the MCP discovery tool.

## Explicit boundaries

| Family | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| drawings.author | research_only | Automatic drawing creation is preview; existing drawing PDF export has its own released path. |
| electronics | research_only | Preview inspection is not unrestricted schematic/PCB authoring or fresh ERC/DRC execution. |
| simulation | human_handoff | Insider simulation APIs are not a released supported solver interface. |
| generative_design | human_handoff | No qualified public generation/solve API is advertised. |
| manufacturing.release | human_handoff | No structured machine collision proof or physical machine control is implemented. |
| sheet_metal.advanced | research_only | Released collection access is not authoring; fold/convert/join variants require separate API qualification. |
| ui.arbitrary | assisted_only | Native raw tools are outside the typed managed facade. They cannot provide managed-policy guarantees. |
| released_variants_outside_registry | not_implemented_in_typed_facade | Sweep/loft/draft/split/mirror, surface/direct geometry authoring, motion-joint variants, appearance editing, hem/Form/mesh exchange, turning/multi-axis/additive and administration require additional reviewed handlers and live qualification. The assisted native route is separate broad authority. |

Cloud read/property/BOM/Automation/enterprise extension contracts are documented in the enterprise guide and exposed by their own discovery tools. Data and compute availability requires its own credentials, scopes, schema/recipe and account qualification. Preview APIs do not count as production coverage.

The implementation plan remains the broader roadmap. This registry does not claim every Fusion UI command, extension, API variant, business-system transition or machine process.
