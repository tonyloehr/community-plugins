description: Prepare, execute and verify authorized Fusion CAD changes using resolved entities, explicit units and state-bound plans. Use for reviewed parameter, sketch, feature, assembly or configuration operations.
---

Inspect the selected document and exact operation schema. Resolve design intent, units, frame, occurrence context and configuration. Generated configuration instances and external sources are not implicitly editable.

Prepare one operation with `fusion_changes_prepare`; review inputs, effects, state and policy blockers. Execute the unchanged hash with a unique idempotency key under the existing scoped grant. Prepare dependent operations only after inspecting the previous result. Parameter batches have documented local atomicity; feature sequences and cross-system writes do not.

Preserve driving constraints and parametric history. Never convert to direct mode, break references, fetch latest versions or interrupt an active command as a convenience.

Verify meaningful numerical postconditions and feature health. Reinspect stale state. For partial/unknown outcomes, inspect receipts and the model before any new write; never blindly replay. `fusion_recovery_prepare` does not silently undo user work.

Saving is a separate cloud effect. Unsupported variants stay explicit. Assisted native tools require their separate broad grant and have different guarantees. See [workflow](../../README.md).
